## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- useReducers

### What I learned

I did this project to solidify my knowledge of state management, so when I had to manage the state of the cart I didn't want to reach for Redux because it would be an overkill for a small state like just the cart, so I used React's useReducers combine with context and I found this to be very simple and optimal.
